# Advent of Code 2020

Here's my repo for my Advent of Code solutions. My previous 2 years have had a few weeks of good effort and then December starts to happen at the same time when the puzzles get harder.

It would be nice to complete them all this year, but I guess we'll have to see.

I have a small utility script to stub out a directory for each day, including a basic python script with support for input args and parsing an input file. I didn't want to go writing a ton of boilerplate code for grid traversal, but it's at least a way to get going quickly with any new problem.
